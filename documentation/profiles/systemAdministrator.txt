Lilia Bradford is a system administrator in Boston, Massachusetts. She handles deployments of all software infrastructure components for Boston Medical Research Co., a small startup located in Cambridge. She was born in Concord MA, and has lived in various parts of Massachusetts all her life. She has a Bachelor's Degree from Boston College in IT Management, and enjoys supporting her local animal shelter on weekends.

Lilia gained a number of talents while earning her degree, such as programming and organizational management. Unfortunately due to the small size of Boston Medical Research Co., Lilia is stuck maintaining deployments of developer infrastructure until the company hires more talent. Talent has been difficult to come by, as the market in Boston is competetive. Because developers deploy multiple times per day using CI/CD to their SAAS platform, Lilia needs to spend weekends upgrading, updating, and in general maintaining their current Jenkins server.

Lilia is particularly interested in the Devops Task Server because being stateless, it can be easily upgraded during the day by using rolling deployments. This means developers will be able to keep working throughout the day, while Lilia deploys a new version of the software.
